Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sarath Chelluri, a passionate programmer with a deep interest in data science and artificial intelligence. With a strong foundation in Python, I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems, whether it's creating AI models, developing data-driven solutions, or working on innovative ideas like language translators for the hearing impaired or unique image generators.

My journey in the tech world started with a love for algorithms and data structures, and over time, I've honed my skills through various projects and certifications, including advanced algorithms from Stanford University. I'm always excited to learn new technologies and apply them to create impactful solutions.

Feel free to explore my repositories, where you'll find a mix of data science projects, AI experiments, and other interesting ventures I'm working on. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
