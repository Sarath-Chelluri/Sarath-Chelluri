Hi! I'm Sarath Chelluri, an MCA graduate with a strong passion for Data Science and Machine Learning.

I have 1 year of experience working with Python and possess skills in SQL and C as well. I'm actively seeking opportunities to learn and contribute in the field of data science, particularly by exploring various machine learning algorithms.

Projects:

Cartoon Face Generator: I built a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to create unique cartoon faces. This project demonstrates my understanding of deep learning concepts.

Voice-to-Sign Language Converter: I developed a project that converts voice input to sign language using the Keras library. This project highlights my interest in applying data science for real-world accessibility solutions.

Feel free to browse my repositories!
